Bonus Features Implemented:
1. Game Resume Countdown:
   - A feature that pauses the game and, upon resuming, displays a countdown from 3 to 1 before gameplay continues.

2. Barrel Movement Based on Real-Time:
   - The barrels' behavior and movements are synchronized with real-time rather than being tied to iterations, creating a more dynamic gameplay experience.

3. Dynamic Placement of Donkey Kong and Pauline:
   - Donkey Kong and Pauline's positions are dynamically determined, ensuring flexibility and interaction with the barrels' movements based on Donkey Kong's placement.

Game Logic Notes:
1. Mario Falls Horizontally While Barrels Fall Straight Down:
   - When Mario falls, his movement includes horizontal motion, whereas barrels fall directly downward, creating distinct physics for each character.

2. Intentional Vertical Fall When Pressing Down:
   - If the player presses "down" while Mario is falling, he transitions to a vertical fall. This behavior is intentionally designed to give players additional control during gameplay.

3. Stop Message Borders Positioned Below Characters:
   - The "Stop" message during pauses is intentionally printed below the characters, ensuring it does not obstruct game visuals or interfere with gameplay clarity.
